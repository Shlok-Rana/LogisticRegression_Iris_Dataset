# LogisticRegression_Iris_Dataset
In this repository i upload two .ipynb files 
1) LogisticRegression In Iris data.ipynb : In this notebook i used only one feature petal width to predict the flower is Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour or either Iris-Virginica and at the end using the matplotlib plot a graph between Petal Width on X-axis and Probability of getting Iris-Virginica on Y-axis.
2) Improved LogisticRegression.ipynb : In this notebook i used all of the features of the iris data and predict the flower.
